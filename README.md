# Netflix_Clone

This repository contains a frontend replica of the Netflix landing page, constructed exclusively using HTML and CSS. This exercise serves as a practical application of the fundamental principles of web development. It specifically focuses on recreating the visual design and core features of the original Netflix interface.

Through this short project, I acquired knowledge of crucial HTML and CSS elements like as input buttons, picture positioning, and SVG implementation. I have become acquainted with the concepts of grid and flexbox. I acquired the knowledge of implementing hover effects on a container.

The project has been effectively implemented utilizing Github.
